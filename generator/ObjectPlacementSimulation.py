"""Object Placing Simulation V1
   Written by Robbie Goldman and Alfred Roberts

Features:
 - Places humans and obstacles randomly
 - Will not intersect walls or other objects
 - Will not be within 4 units of bases

 - This is a modification of the placement script used to show how a map could be placed
